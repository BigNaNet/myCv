:END:
I am interested in the Junior DevOp position advertised in your website. Given my
related experience and capacity to learn, I would appreciate your consideration
for this job opening.

Having earned my Master in Physics Engineering from Coimbra University, I have
been exposed to a vibrant knowledge environment where learning was always
encouraged and seen as the best knowledge gained.

I have  already experienced this advantage as I joined Vestas as an
Operational Forecast Engineer where I face daily new challenges,
technical as well as in comunication.

Since I started at Vestas, I found myself exposed to a fully operating system
that needs nurture and quick solutions when problems rise. This allowed me to
work in a fast working environment and solution driven, as customers where
expecting the system to be fully operational. The contact with the forecasting
system allowed me to be emersed in an linux environment and develop my scripting capabilities,
specially in the Python language.

I have been exposed to  CI/CD pipelines as well
as k8s environments, where I am currently working on the monitoring
Infrastructure which alllows me to work with tools such as Prometheus, elasticsearch,
 and the alerting conterparts.

I enjoy to learn new technologies as well as new ways of solving problems. I
belive that all the previous considerations qualify me for this position. I
look forward to discussing how my set of skills can be of value to Zhülke.

Thank you for your time, consideration and forthcoming response.

* Run me                                                           :noexport:
